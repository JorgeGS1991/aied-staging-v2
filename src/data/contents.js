          "<p>Welcome from all of us at Work-Learn!</p><p>We are interested in helping people like you gain new skills and expanding the opportunities you have entering (or re-entering) careers in computer and information technology. To accomplish this goal, we need to learn about who you are and what your experiences are while you are in the program.</p><p>This will happen in a couple of ways:</p><ol><li>Complete the Qualtrics Survey linked below to provide us with some background information about you and your past education experiences. The answers to this survey are confidential. Your name will not be used so no one will know who you are. All information about you will be kept in locked offices of the research team and information kept on computers will be password protected.</li><li>Schedule a time to meet with a member of our team either in person or online. This will be the first of three meetings you will have with a Work-Learn team member as you move through the program. We will be using the same email address you logged into the Work-Learn Classroom to contact you for scheduling.</li></ol><p>We will be on campus at SFH _________________ and will make every effort to schedule a time to meet with you in person while we're here. If this isn't possible, one of our team members will be contacting you by email to schedule a time to meet virtually using an online communications platform (zoom).</p><p>Finally, we know that your time is valuable, and we truly appreciate all of your efforts as you work your way through the program. For this reason, you will be given $_______ for each of the three meetings you have with us.</p><p>If you have any questions before you get started, please direct those questions by email to <a href='mailto:worklearnproject@gmail.com'>worklearnproject@gmail.com</a>.</p>",

                <p>What is Computer Literacy?</p>
                <p>Computer literacy can be defined as the level of experience and comfort someone has using computers to accomplish a goal. Your skill level can range from having no or very basic knowledge of how to use a computer all the way to operating common software programs or being able to write code. It's important to keep in mind that this definition is always changing and evolving depending on the advances made in that technology. It covers the basics of being able to functionally use the physical elements of a computer to achieve some task.</p>
                
                <p>What is Digital Literacy?</p>
                <p>Digital literacy is a little bit different. It refers to a person's ability to use computers and other digital media to find, evaluate, and communicate information. While early digital literacy definitions were more closely related to computer literacy skills, the birth of the internet quickly led to a definition that included the creation, gathering, and sharing of information through the use of a computer. These skills include the ability to use social media platforms (like Facebook or Twitter), search engines (Google), and office productivity suites (Office 365 and GSuite/Google Workplace).</p>
                
                <p>What's Next?</p>
                <p>To learn a little bit more about computer and digital literacy, check out the lesson below from Northstar Online Learning on Basic Computer Skills.</p>
                
                <p>Using a trackpad instead of a mouse can be tricky. The Mousercise! link below will help you practice navigating around your screen using the trackpad. If you're using a mouse, this can be good practice for you too!</p>
                
                <p>Want a little more practice before moving on? Check out the mini-course, Getting Started on a Computer, to work on your computer literacy skills.</p>
                
                <p>To get started on improving your digital literacy skills, check out the lesson on Using a PC. It will take you through the basics of working on a desktop, working with windows, and handling files and folders.</p>

                <p>Before You Proceed to Other Modules</p>
                <p>Before you can move on to the other modules of the Work Learn Classroom, we want to make sure you have the computer and digital literacy skills needed to be successful in the program. So, we are asking that you complete the Basic Computer Skills and Internet Basics assessments from the Northstar Digital Literacy website linked below with a score of 85% or better. If you are not successful the first time, please go back to the Basic Computer and Digital Literacy Practice module to improve your skills.</p>
                
                <p>When you get to the Northstar website, please click on the green "Take an Assessment" button to get to the menu options you will need to select to complete the assessments. You will find the Basic Computer Skills and Internet Basics under Essential Computer Skills in the left column. An illustrative tutorial of these steps is provided below for you if needed.</p>
                
                <p>Helpful Hints</p>
                <ul>
                <li>You can take the assessments multiple times by using the private mode of your web browser. If you do not use the private viewing mode, you will only be able to take the assessments once per day.</li>
                <li>These assessments have voice-over prompts for each question. Please be mindful of others around you and use headphones, turn on closed captioning, or mute your device. The platform tutorial will also go through how to do this.</li>
                <li>At the beginning of each assessment, there is a tutorial that goes through how to complete the assessments. This tutorial will show you how to navigate through each screen, record your answers, review and change your answers, submit your answers, and receive your final score.</li>
                <li>Make sure you are confident in your answers before you submit your assessment for grading. You will not be able to return to the questions after the assessment is graded.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>When you are done with each assessment, please press Print Result and download your results as a PDF file. Upload each of the files to this assignment. Once your scores are verified to be 85% or better, you will be able to move on to the Computational Thinking module.</p>

                <span>Knowing<br> how to use the software you are going to be using to learn something 
                <br>new is one of the most important first steps you can take to be 
                <br>successful as an online learner. This module gives you a brief 
                <br>description of a few of the Google applications you'll be using the 
                <br>most.&nbsp; Most of the tutorials provided to you offer a step-by-step guide 
                <br>for you to walk through the different applications. Some of them have 
                <br>specific activities and quizzes that you can complete to test your <br>abilities. 
                <br><br>**<i>PLEASE NOTE:&nbsp; You will need to create an account<br> on GCF Global in order 
                to save your progress on any of the step-by-step<br> tutorials provided by that organization. 
                This is a free account and you<br> can use your WorkLearn Google account credentials to log in.</i>
                <br><b><br>Google Classroom</b><br><br>Google Classroom is the <i>learning platform </i>the Work Learn project is using provide you the materials you need to complete our coursework in <i>Computational Thinking</i>, <i>Python</i>, <i>Mainframe</i>, and <i>COBOL</i>.<br> While Google Classroom is pretty easy to use, it does take a little bit<br> of practice to get the hang of. Lucky for you, we have found a really <br>good video and step-by-step tutorial to get you started using Google <br>Classroom right away. <br><br><b>Google Drive</b><br><br>Google drive is<br> cloud-based data storage. This storage is part of your Google account <br>and can be accessed in the Google Apps menu bar (9 dots on the top right<br> next to your icon). When you use any one of Google's productivity 
                <br>applications (Docs, Slides, Sheets, etc), they are automatically saved <br>in your Google Drive account for you. To learn more about Google Drive <br>(and Docs), take a few minutes to go over the tutorial and/or watch the <br>video presentation below. <br><br><b>Google Docs</b><br><b><br></b>One <br>of the most important apps you'll want to learn more about is Google <br>Docs. This is Google's word processing program and works a lot like <br>Microsoft Word. There are some differences between the two, though, so <br>it's a good idea to start your review of the Google Drive and Docs <br>tutorial at Section 7 to make your own comparisons between the two <br>products. <br><br><b>Google Slides<br></b><br><br>Some of your lessons and <br>reading materials may be presented to you as Google Slides. <br>Understanding how to navigate this app will help you access the material<br> you need to complete your coursework. Like Google Docs, there are a lot<br> of similarities (and differences) between Google Slides and Microsoft <br>Power Point, so it's important to be familiar with both programs. Check <br>out the tutorial and/or video presentations below to learn more about <br>Google Slides<br><b><br></b><br><b>What To Turn In:</b><br><b><br></b><br>Complete the Challenge! in each section of the GCFGlobal tutorials. For activities that require answering questions, you will upload your answers as part of your assignment. Please use one document for each tutorial. When you are asked to complete an activity, (like using a template from the Google Template Gallery) upload the completed activity with your Challenge! answers.</span>
