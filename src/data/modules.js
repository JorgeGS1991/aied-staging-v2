                <p>What is Computer Literacy?</p>
                <p>Computer literacy can be defined as the level of experience and comfort someone has using computers to accomplish a goal. Your skill level can range from having no or very basic knowledge of how to use a computer all the way to operating common software programs or being able to write code. It's important to keep in mind that this definition is always changing and evolving depending on the advances made in that technology. It covers the basics of being able to functionally use the physical elements of a computer to achieve some task.</p>
                
                <p>What is Digital Literacy?</p>
                <p>Digital literacy is a little bit different. It refers to a person's ability to use computers and other digital media to find, evaluate, and communicate information. While early digital literacy definitions were more closely related to computer literacy skills, the birth of the internet quickly led to a definition that included the creation, gathering, and sharing of information through the use of a computer. These skills include the ability to use social media platforms (like Facebook or Twitter), search engines (Google), and office productivity suites (Office 365 and GSuite/Google Workplace).</p>
                
                <p>What's Next?</p>
                <p>To learn a little bit more about computer and digital literacy, check out the lesson below from Northstar Online Learning on Basic Computer Skills.</p>
                
                <p>Using a trackpad instead of a mouse can be tricky. The Mousercise! link below will help you practice navigating around your screen using the trackpad. If you're using a mouse, this can be good practice for you too!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You can take the assessments multiple times by using the private mode of your web browser. If you do not use the private viewing mode, you will only be able to take the assessments once per day.</li>
                    <li>These assessments have voice-over prompts for each question. Please be mindful of others around you and use headphones, turn on closed captioning, or mute your device. The platform tutorial will also go through how to do this.</li>
                    <li>At the beginning of each assessment, there is a tutorial that goes through how to complete the assessments. This tutorial will show you how to navigate through each screen, record your answers, review and change your answers, submit your answers, and receive your final score.</li>
                    <li>Make sure you are confident in your answers before you submit your assessment for grading. You will not be able to return to the questions after the assessment is graded.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When you are done with each assessment, please press Print Result and download your results as a PDF file. Upload each of the files to this assignment. Once your scores are verified to be 85% or better, you will be able to move on to the Computational Thinking module.</p>

                <span>Knowing how to use the software you are going to be using to learn something 
                new is one of the most important first steps you can take to be 
                successful as an online learner. This module gives you a brief 
                description of a few of the Google applications you'll be using the 
                most.&nbsp; Most of the tutorials provided to you offer a step-by-step guide 
                for you to walk through the different applications. Some of them have 
                specific activities and quizzes that you can complete to test your abilities.<br><br>
                **<i>PLEASE NOTE:&nbsp; You will need to create an account on GCF Global in order 
                to save your progress on any of the step-by-step tutorials provided by that organization. 
                This is a free account and you can use your WorkLearn Google account credentials to log in.</i><br><br>
                <b>Google Classroom</b><br><br>Google Classroom is the <i>learning platform </i>the Work Learn project is using provide you the materials you need to complete our coursework in <i>Computational Thinking</i>, <i>Python</i>, <i>Mainframe</i>, and <i>COBOL</i>. While Google Classroom is pretty easy to use, it does take a little bit of practice to get the hang of. Lucky for you, we have found a really good video and step-by-step tutorial to get you started using Google Classroom right away. <br><br><b>Google Drive</b><br><br>Google drive is cloud-based data storage. This storage is part of your Google account and can be accessed in the Google Apps menu bar (9 dots on the top right next to your icon). When you use any one of Google's productivity 
                applications (Docs, Slides, Sheets, etc), they are automatically saved in your Google Drive account for you. To learn more about Google Drive (and Docs), take a few minutes to go over the tutorial and/or watch the video presentation below. <br><br><b>Google Docs</b><b></b><br><br>One of the most important apps you'll want to learn more about is Google Docs. This is Google's word processing program and works a lot like Microsoft Word. There are some differences between the two, though, so it's a good idea to start your review of the Google Drive and Docs tutorial at Section 7 to make your own comparisons between the two products. <br><br><b>Google Slides</b><br><br>Some of your lessons and reading materials may be presented to you as Google Slides. Understanding how to navigate this app will help you access the material you need to complete your coursework. Like Google Docs, there are a lot of similarities (and differences) between Google Slides and Microsoft Power Point, so it's important to be familiar with both programs. Check out the tutorial and/or video presentations below to learn more about Google Slides<b></b><br><br><b>What To Turn In:</b><br><br><b></b>Complete the Challenge! in each section of the GCFGlobal tutorials. For activities that require answering questions, you will upload your answers as part of your assignment. Please use one document for each tutorial. When you are asked to complete an activity, (like using a template from the Google Template Gallery) upload the completed activity with your Challenge! answers.</span>

                    <span><b>Your Digital Footprint<br></b><br>Digital footprint refers to the trails, traces, and crumbs that are left behind after someone uses the internet. This information is available for others to find without a lot of effort, and never goes away. Not only is your personal digital footprint affected by what you post and do online, it is also affected by what others might post about you online. Having a negative digital footprint, even if it's from a long time ago, 
                    can have consequences on future employment opportunities, so it's important to understand what contributes to your digital footprint and how it can impact your future. <br><br>Here are just a few examples of online sources that can make up your digital footprint:<ul><li>Social media posts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. 
                    <br></li><li>YouTube uploads, channel subscriptions, and public comment history</li><li>Postings on Yelp, Amazon, Google</li><li>Personal websites, blog posts, and digital art portfolios</li><li>Accepted cookies from websites you have visited<br></li></ul>So, here are a couple of recommendations to keep in mind:&nbsp; 1) Always think twice or even three times before you post questionable content or opinions on the internet--including your social media accounts; and 2) Maybe even consider maintaining separate accounts for personal and professional use to mitigate potential bleed through. <br><br><i>**For more information and practice on identifying sources of your digital footprint, check out the video, </i><b><i>Your Digital Footprint</i></b><i>. You'll test your knowledge with a skills assessment on the Northstar Digital Literacy site, </i><b><i>Using Technology in Daily Life--Your Digital Footprint</i></b><i> a little later. </i><br><br><b>Personal Use of Technology at Work</b><br><br>Have you ever checked your socials or email, do some online shopping, or even read up on the daily news while you're on the clock at work? You are not alone and most workers will admit that they either use their work computers for personal use or use their personal devices while at work. Sometimes this is okay. Research has shown that taking a short break from your work will also give your brain a break, and this can improve your productivity. It's also been shown that these brief online breaks can improve your mood while you're working because you tend to visit sites you want to or enjoy going to. <br><br><br>Whether or not this is an okay use of your on-the-clock-time depends on a lot of different variables and has its limits. First of all, be aware of your employer's policy on personal use of technology at work. Many employers will have this policy spelled out in their employee handbook. If they don't, ask before you start scrolling. Second, make sure you are getting your work done, its done well, and you're meeting your deadlines. Ultimately, you are being paid to do work for your employer, and that should be your priority while you're there. 
                    Finally, looking at funny pet videos on YouTube would be appropriate, going to sexually explicit, gambling, or sites selling illegal materials employer is paying you for.&nbsp;<br><br><i>**Take a couple of minutes to watch the video, </i><b><i>Good and Proper Use of Technology in the Workplace</i></b><i>, for more information on this topic.</i><br><br><b>Crafting Professional Emails</b><br><b><br></b>In the video you just watched, you learned a little bit about email etiquette at work. As you enter into a work setting where email is often a primary source of communication, it will become more and more important for you to know how to craft high quality professional emails. Direct messaging (DM)/instant messaging (IM) is also a popular way to communicate with your co-workers, and in a lot of ways is very similar to sending and receiving text messages. However, it's also equally important to remember that there a few more guidelines you need to pay attention to when you're using DMs at work. <br><br>Regardless of whether you are communicating through an email or a direct messaging app, your writing should always be professional and business-friendly. The tutorials and videos below will give you a good idea of how to craft a quality work-ready email and DM. <br><br><br><i>**Check out the tutorials on, </i><b><i>Email Basics, Beyond Email, Communication Skills, </i></b><i>and </i><b><i>Business Communication</i></b><i>. We've also provided you with a video series for the </i><b><i>Business Communication</i></b><i> tutorial that provides several short videos to reinforce your learning.</i></span>

            <span><b>Introduction</b><br><br>This course is intended to introduce you to the foundational skills you'll need to learn the Python coding language. It is designed to give you some background knowledge in the ways that computers help us to solve problems and scale solutions. By the end of the course, you should be able to define the four components of computational thinking (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms) and explain how each of these components appears both within different kinds of computer technologies and within our everyday lives. Being able to reason in a computational way will make you a more powerful programmer by offering you a way to identify problems, solve them logically, and simplify those solutions in order to make sure that they work efficiently.&nbsp;<br><br>This module will begin with an introduction to computational thinking and some practice with basic problem solving. Next, you'll explore how to break down more complex problems, recognize patterns, create solutions, and build algorithms. This initial course should take about sixteen hours to complete.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Objectives</b><br>By the end of this course, you will be able to:&nbsp;<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;"><li>define the components of computational thinking (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms);</li><li>connect the components of computational thinking to your everyday life;</li><li>identify and break down challenging problems into smaller parts;</li><li>recognize patterns and use them to simplify complex ideas;</li><li>articulate how one idea might translate into many situations;</li><li>begin to use algorithms in simple coding exercises.</li></ul></span>

                <span><b><i>Computational Thinking: How Computers Think</i></b><br><br><i>Computational thinking</i> is a way of solving problems. It is called <i>computational thinking</i> because we are specifically contemplating about how a computer could solve a problem. We use <i>computational thinking </i>when we write programs to control computers. We can also use <i>computational thinking</i> in everyday life. Computers are often used to model the real world, so many of the problems we solve with computers are like problems we solve in real life. <br><br><b><i>Four Cornerstones to Computational Thinking</i></b><br><br>There are four key techniques (cornerstones) to <i>computational thinking</i>: <i>decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithms</i><br><ul><li><i>Decomposition -- </i>breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable parts;&nbsp; <br></li><li><i>Pattern Recognition</i>&nbsp;– looking for similarities among and within problems;</li><li><i>Abstraction</i> – focusing on the important information only, ignoring irrelevant detail;</li><li><i>Algorithms</i>&nbsp;-- developing a step-by-step solution to the problem, or the rules to follow to solve the problem.</li></ul><b><i>What Problems Can Computational Thinking Solve?</i></b><br><br>Another element of <i>computational thinking</i> is knowing what kinds of problems can be solved well by a computer and what problems are better for humans to resolve. A computer is <i>really</i> good at recording, processing, and searching for data making them a great tool for keeping track of data and completing complex computational tasks. On the other hand, computers are not very good at completing creative tasks or providing subjective opinions making humans still better at these activities. So, although computers are getting more powerful and sophisticated in what they <i>can</i> do, people are still required to program them!<br> <br><b><i>Here's an Example<br></i></b><br>In real life, you might have to fill out a form while at a government office. 
                That form has stuff on it like your name and address. In computing, we would call your entries on the form <i>data</i>. This data needs to be stored somewhere--like in a folder placed into a filing cabinet--and the people at the office will need to be able to find that folder later. <br><br>In the computer, the form would be called a <i>file</i> that would be stored in a <i>folder</i> on the hard drive. Then, if a person needs to access the data in the file, they can either go directly to the folder the file is stored in (just like pulling the folder from the cabinet in real life), or they can look for the file using the computer's search function. <i><br></i><br><i>Computational thinking</i> can help us think about how to store the file and also how to search for it, both in real life and in the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br><br><b><i>Final Thoughts</i></b><br><br><i>Computational Thinking:</i><ul><li>Is a way of solving problems;</li><li>Helps us formulate solutions that can be easily carried out by a computer;&nbsp;</li><li>With <i>computational thinking</i> we solve problems creatively; </li><li>With <i>computational thinking</i> we get to the root of the problem, which is a crucial step in solving it.</li></ul></span>

                <span>Before computers can be used to solve a problem, the problem and the ways in which it can be resolved must be understood. <i>Decomposition</i> helps us by breaking down complex programs into more manageable components.<br><br><b><i>What is Decomposition?</i></b><br><br><i>Decomposition </i>is the process of breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable components. These smaller parts can then be examined and solved and are generally simpler to work with than the larger, more complex problem (like writing a computer program). <br><br><b><i>Why is Decomposition Important?</i></b><br><br>If a problem is not decomposed, it is much harder to solve. Dealing with many different stages all at once is much more difficult than breaking a problem down into a number of smaller problems and solving each one, one at a time. Breaking the problem down into smaller parts means that each smaller problem can be examined in greater detail. <br><br>Similarly, trying to understand how a complex system works is easier using decomposition. For example, understanding how a bicycle works is more straightforward if the whole bike is separated into smaller parts (like brakes, gears, wheels, etc.), and each part can be examined to see how it works in more detail. <br><br><b><i>How Do We Use Decomposition in Computer Programming?</i></b><br><br>As a programmer, you will basically face the same problems each and every time you approach a coding assignment--namely, you will need to find out what the program is going to do and then figure out how you will go about building the solution. <i>Decomposition</i> will help you solve this problem. <br><br>It's important to understand that decomposition doesn't stop at identifying generalized components of a problem. You need to keep decomposing the problem until you arrive at a series of steps that cannot be broken down any further. Then, once you are done decomposing, you should be able to stick the components back together to make a complete program.<br><br>When you have broken the problem down into a set of clear, easy to follow steps, the problem is <i>fully decomposed</i>. <i>Decomposition</i> 
                to this degree also allows for delegation and any other programmer should be able to follow what needs to be done easily.<br><br><b><i>Here's an Example</i></b><br><br>Suppose you have been asked to write an app for work. This is a large and complex problem with a lot of things to consider. <i>Decomposition </i>will help us break our app construction down into smaller, more manageable parts. Answering the following questions could be a good way of figuring out what the many components are to solving the problem:<br><ul><li><i>What</i> <i>kind of app is requested?</i></li><li><i>Who is the target audience for the app?</i></li><li><i>What type of graphics will be involved?</i></li><li><i>What audio will be included?</i></li><li><i>What software will you use to build the app?</i></li><li><i>How will you test your app?</i></li><li><i>How will your app be distributed?</i></li></ul></span>
